This project is an Enhanced Fork of the Media Player extension originally developed by InBasic.

Original Work:
Author: InBasic

Source: GitHub Repository

Base Framework: Video.js

Kundan's Enhancements (Pro-Button Version):
While the core engine belongs to the original author, I have implemented the following "Next Level" upgrades to better suit power users and academic needs:

Extreme Playback Engine: Modified api.js to support playback rates from 0.25x to 10x or more (Original typically caps at 2x-8x).

Unified Settings UI: Developed the advancedSettingsPlugin to consolidate multiple standalone toggles into a single efficient interface.

Manifest V3 Migration: Refactored the background logic into a standard Service Worker (worker.js) to ensure long-term browser compatibility.

Custom Styling Suite: Added a dedicated User Style Editor in data/styling/ for real-time CSS customization
